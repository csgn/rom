# r â—¦ m

In-Memory MapReduce implementation in Scala

# Components

1. App: Beginning of the mapreduce program. User defines its own configuration
and mapper/reducer functions.

2. Reactor (is a Task): It reads and splits input files, forks coordinator and
workers, and returns the result to the user.

3. Coordinator (is a Task): It assigns tasks to workers. Act like a messenger
between other workers. It returns the result to the reactor.

4. Worker (is a Task): It runs map and reduce functions that givens by the user at App.

5. Task: It is a fiber(thread) and has a lifecycle like 'idle', 'run', 'stop'.

# Execution Steps

1. User creates App with configuration and functions.
```
object Main extends rom.App {
    def run: IO[ExitCode] = for {
        spec = rom.Spec(
            "input" -> (
                "format" -> "text",
                "filePattern" -> "log-*.txt"
            ),
            "numOfFibers" -> 2
        )
        mapper = rom.Mapper("WordCounter") { ... }
        reducer = rom.Reducer("Adder") { ... }
        proc = rom.Proc(spec, mapper, reducer)
        result <- proc.run
    } yield IO.println(result).as(ExitCode.Success)
}
```
